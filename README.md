# GWR_GNG_classifier
## A Growing When Required and Growing Neural Gas simple classifier
An extension for classification including 2 types of Neural Gas, the Growing When Required (GWR) and Growing Neural Gas (GNG).  Based on (Konsoulas, 2013) see GNG_LICENSE - with a wrapper for the GNG and my own implementation of a GWR neural gas and a simple classifier as simplified version from what Parisi used see (Parisi, 2015).

Included there is a simple example of a classifier with 4 shapes (which is trivially classifiable with 4 nodes), to show how the gas constructs the topological description of a dataset.
